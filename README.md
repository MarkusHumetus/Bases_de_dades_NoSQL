# Non-relational and not-only-relational Data Bases

## Objectives
Exercises to learn and practice to work with **non-relational or not-only relational DDBB**. This exercise is part of a full course composed by 15 differnt sprints to adquire the skills to start a career as Data Science. The course is taught in person at the ITAcademy from Barcelona Activa (January- July 2022). The work in this reposirory correspond to the 14th sprint of the course.

## Getting Started
The Jupyter Notebook was run in **Python3.7** and next libraries were installed specifically for the use of this tipe of DDBB:
**pymongo**: driver for DDBB (Motor could be used as alternative)
**dnspython**: to use cloud version 
**datetime** for date&time data managing

Take care to change password and name of the DDBB for the connection text adress.

One must be logged in the MongoDB service (free account) and install: 
1. The **MongoDB Community Server**(version 5.0.9 installed for Windows) which should include MOngoDB Comapss.


There is also the file requirements.txt that include all libraries installed in the environment used to run the Jupyter Notebook.
